+<html><body>Lezonne:<br>
+Are you a mercenary too?<br>
+We've had a lot of them lately. Probably to ward
+off the Mysterious Assassins who occasionally
+invade and turn this place into a <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font>. Â  
+<br>
+And then it becomes peaceful again. But we
+don't know when it becomes a <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font> or how
+long the <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font> remains, so it's frustrating.
+<br>
+I wonder what's going on...
+<br>
+We don't know when it will turn into a
+<font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font>, so I can give you a buff just in
+case... I can't give it to you for free... It will be 
+<font color=LEVEL>200000 Adena</font>.
+<br>
+<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest GainakBuff donate_adena">Give him Adena and get the buff.</Button>
+</body></html>
